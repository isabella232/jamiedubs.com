I run a [[Plex]] home media center that stores all my legally-acquired movies & TV shows and streams. My current stack is a mid-power NUC, a 4-bay Synology NAS, and a Chromecast Ultra on the TV, usually controlled by an iPhone.

One of Plex's most interesting features is being able [share your server with friends](https://support.plex.tv/articles/201105738-creating-and-managing-server-shares/). My friends & family just need to sign up for a free Plex account, add me as a friend, and can then stream anything from my library. Or at least as much as my limited cable Internet upload bandwidth allows (sorry)

Last year I discovered there is an entire marketplace for renting out access to large Plex setups â€“ [r/plexshares](https://www.reddit.com/r/plexshares/). Pricing generally starts at about $5/month for access to libraries with tens of thousands of movies and TV shows. Some of these are multi-region setups with failovers and off-cloud backups. There is some webscale-level devops work here, and all of it happens above-ground: these networks operate openly on reddit, not on .onion darknet markets.

Customer support is often done on very well-run Discord servers. Support requests are often just requests for new movies or shows. Members can chat with each other about what's worth watching. The experience is excellent.

There's two major business models: P4S (payment for service), where you just pay $5/month for access, vs. S4S (share for service) where you give access to your library in exchange for access to theirs. The latter is more popular on [r/SharePLEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/SharePLEX/)


There's some post-capitalist ghosts of private torrent tracker here. Elite music trackers like oink.fm and its successors what.cd, waffles.fm et al were all strict about `ratio` and participants contribution back to the illicit public good. To keep downloading, you needed to seed popular torrents, upload desirable original content, or in some cases, just contribute cash to help run the servers. Plexshares, by contrast, are dominated by simple $5-10/month P4S setups.

I've also heard there is a similar underground economy for [[Parsec]]-based cloud gaming. Got a beefy gaming rig that mostly sits idle, and crypto mining not ROI positive? Just rent it out for others to play your games! Cloud gaming has come a long way, and Parsec's latency is excellent, totally managable for all of the but the most twitchy multiplayer games. [GeForceNow](https://geforcenow.com) and [Shadow.tech](https://shadow.tech) are great legit options, but the selection is limited, and you have to actually buy the games. Wouldn't it be nice to just pay per-minute for a machine that's fully loaded with AAA titles?

Follow-ups: 
* [[crypto]] for censorship-resistant underground rental markets like this :sweat_smile:
* p2p live TV streaming resyndication idea (e.g. competing with SnapStream)
* what other niche services exist like this?
