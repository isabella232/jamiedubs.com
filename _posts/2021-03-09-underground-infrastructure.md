I run a [[Plex]] home media center that stores all my very legally-acquired movies & TV shows and streams. My current stack is a mid-power NUC, a 4-bay Synology NAS, and a Chromecast Ultra on the TV, usually controlled by an iPhone.

One of Plex's most interesting features is being able [share your server with other Plex users](https://support.plex.tv/articles/201105738-creating-and-managing-server-shares/). My friends & family just need to sign up for a free Plex account, add me as a friend, and can then stream anything from my library. Or at least as much as my limited cable Internet upload bandwidth allows (sorry)

Last year I discovered there is an entire marketplace for renting out access to large Plex setups â€“ [r/plexshares](https://www.reddit.com/r/plexshares/). Pricing generally starts at about $5/month for access to libraries with tens of thousands of movies and TV shows. Some of these are multi-region setups with failovers and off-cloud backups. This is some webscale-level devops work happening here.

There's two major business models: P4S (payment for service), where you just pay $5/month for access, vs. S4S (share for service) where you give access to your library in exchange for access to theirs. The latter is more popular on [r/SharePLEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/SharePLEX/), but that subreddit is only 10% the size of the pay-for-access subreddit.

Customer support is often handled on well-run Discord servers. Members can chat with each other about what's worth watching. The support requests are often just requests for new movies or shows. The experience is excellent.

For contrast: Netflix costs me $12/month and has 4-5k titles, which is a fraction of what's available on r/plexshares servers. So while there's obviously a bang-for-the-buck benefit, I think it goes deeper than that:

* There are tons of wonderful movies that are not available on any of the major streaming services. Or it might be on the service, but not available in your region, which is infuriating.
* Figuring out which streaming service has a particular title is a pain in the neck. It's extremely convenient having everything accessible inside one app.
* Plex's apps are better than most streaming service's apps. They're available on almost every platform, they're well-designed, and they're essentially free. Their paid [Plex Pass](https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/) offering is $5/month and provides advanced features that most folks don't really need.
* The social experience of a Plexshare is great. Being on a Discord server with other movie buffs is great. Having a direct communcation channel with staff is great. It has vibes of supporting a local business where you know the owner.
* It's fun to stick it to the man

Interestingly, these networks operate openly on reddit, and not on .onion darknet markets. I'm unclear on the legality of this whole setup, particularly e.g. if the server operators are in a copyvio-friendly jurisdiction like Sweden or New Zealand. How culpable is the end-user for streaming pirated content? Is it better or worse that they paid for access?

I've  heard there is a similar underground economy for [[Parsec]]-based cloud gaming. Got a beefy gaming rig that mostly sits idle, and crypto mining isn't ROI positive? Just rent it out for others to play your games! 
Cloud gaming has come a long way. Parsec's latency is excellent, totally usable in all but the most twitchy multiplayer games. [GeForce Now](https://geforcenow.com) and [Shadow.tech](https://shadow.tech) are great legit options for cloud gaming, but the game selection is limited, and you have to actually buy the games. Wouldn't it be nice to just pay per minute for a gaming rig that's fully loaded with AAA titles?

Lastly, there's some ghosts of the private torrent trackers in all this. Elite music trackers like oink.fm and its successors What.cd and Waffles.fm were all strict about `ratio` and participants contributing back to the illicit public good. To keep downloading, you needed to seed popular torrents, upload desirable original content, or in some cases, just contribute cash to help run the servers. Plexshares, by contrast, are dominated by simple $5-10/month P4S setups. Something someting economics.

Thanks to [ChrisK](https://twitter.com/ckurdziel) for feedback on early drafts.

Follow-ups: 
* [[crypto]] for censorship-resistant underground rental markets like this :sweat_smile:
* p2p live TV streaming resyndication idea (e.g. competing with SnapStream)
* what other niche services exist like this?
