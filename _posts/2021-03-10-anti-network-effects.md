Back in January Tushar Jain from Multicoin Capital tweeted about [[anti-network effects]], a term I hadn't really heard before:

This is unusual for Internet software. Growth is religion in startupland, and it's rare that more users is actually a problem. If anything, it's usually a scaling issues, which is a [[money problem]], as in, "where am I going to store all this money?"

But in the real world this kind of anti-network effect is nothing new. Every time I go to a bar or nightclub I am walking a beautiful chicken-and-egg tightrope:

Basically what I'm trying to say is that the [[Ethereum]] club is too poppin. I heard they're expanding the club, but that takes a minute. Meanwhile I've got people sweating on me and bumping my drink, so I'm actively checking out other spots. 

Ethereum is New York's hottest nightclub, but it's not the only nightclub.
