Back in January Tushar Jain from Multicoin Capital tweeted about [[anti-network effects]], a term I hadn't really heard before:

[!["Ethereum is suffering from anti-network effects. Each new user makes the system less usable for other users by crowding them out. For example, it currently costs $100 in gas to trade on Uniswap. Simply sending some ETH costs around $10. DeFi has outgrown Ethereum."](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s%2Fvaq6zhfwnyewhhm%2FScreen%2520Shot%25202021-03-10%2520at%252011-04-33%2520%25285%2529%2520Tushar%2520Jain%2520on%2520Twitter%2520Ethereum%2520is%2520suffering%2520from%2520anti-network%2520effects.%2520Each%2520new%2520user%2520makes%2520the%2520system%2520less%2520usable%2520for%2520ot%2526%2520.png)](https://twitter.com/tusharjain_/status/1345766256297689088?lang=en)

This is unusual for Internet software. Growth is religion in startupland, and it's rare that more users is actually a problem. If anything it's usually a scaling issues, which is a [[money problem]] â€“ "where the heck am I going to store all this money?"

But in the real world this kind of anti-network effect is nothing new. Every time I go to a bar or nightclub I am walking a beautiful chicken-and-egg tightrope:

Basically what I'm trying to say is that the [[Ethereum]] club is too poppin. I heard they're expanding the club, but that takes a minute. Meanwhile I've got people sweating on me and bumping my drink, so I'm actively checking out other spots.

Ethereum is New York's hottest nightclub, but it's not the only nightclub.
