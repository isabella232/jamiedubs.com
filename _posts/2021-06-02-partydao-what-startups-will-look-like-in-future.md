There was a livestreamed collaborative design session for [PartyDAO]() last night, which sounds like it was a lot of fun. I missed the stream, but there is a [public Figma board](https://www.figma.com/file/129WL3Stz1PKSMblzG0ton/PartyDAO?node-id=0%3A1) you can dig through:

The group is building PartyBid, an app for collectively bidding on NFTs (a la [PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/pleasrdao))

It has been amazing watching the PartyDAO team assemble and start building over the last few weeks. The quality and speed has been comparable to a tight-knit, VC-backed startup, but it is definitely not that. Someone posted an idea on Twitter – ""wouldn't it be cool if you could deploy an automatic DAO to bid on an NFT auction?" – and then a group of people spontaneously organized, raised money from whoever would contribute, and are now bringing open-source software to life. It's only been a month since that first tweet. 

Unlike most DAOs, which generally just collect and distribute money, they are actively building and shipping software; unlike most small open-source projects, they have a budget and a path for future funding.

I believe PartyDAO is a sneak preview of what many startups will look like in the future. 
Spontaneously organized, cooperatively-owned, and funded by community tokens and crowdfunding. 

They are open-source not necessarily because of their belief in contributing to the public good, but because it is an excellent marketing and recruitment strategy. They are cooperatively-organized not just because it is more fair and inclusive, but because it is less work, and everyone understands the benefits of [[skin in the game]]. The morally superior path provides practical benefits.

A brief history of PartyDAO:
- the project starts with [a tweet from Denis Nazarov](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) that [Anish Agnihotri builds over the weekend.](https://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri/status/1384372491053846531)
- there's lots of interest, it feels worth pursuing further! Folks are even willing to put in some money to see it come to life
- instead of a Kickstarter campaign, which can take weeks to put together, Denis [uses Mirror to crowdfund 25 ETH in a matter of hours](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) ($60k-ish)
- Denis transfers control of the assets to a multi-sig wallet, to be managed by the backers of the crowdfund
- a Discord server is created to organize further

So a week after the initial concept, the startup has closed their seed round.

Platforms like [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz) (for crowdfunding) and [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org) and [Boardroom](https://boardroom.info) (for governance) combine beautifully with GitHub, Figma, Discord and other pieces of the modern product development stack. They are all remote, async, and open-source/"work in public"-friendly.

Next up:

- one of the PartyDAO members volunteers to manage the project (John Palmer aka [jpalmz](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer))
- along with other backers, he drafts a short project overview and draft budget
- the plan and budget are voted on and approved by the other backers using [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/partydao.eth/proposal/QmbeYtJshFo2aoj59HfZe3DhdmVdksdv15fp8amQwSSswq) 
- folks apply for the various jobs – design, frontend dev, solidity dev, security review, etc. This is all done asyncronously, via Discord
- team members were unanimously approved in [another vote](https://snapshot.org/#/partydao.eth/proposal/QmWXXiPuonf4k8gGAU7NvBhe61gWJGFT4dZqemvYP5whBZ), and work begins

So less than a month later, PartyDAO is a brand new, cooperatively-owned, collectively-governed startup. There's a team, there's money in the bank, and the development engines are firing on all cylinders. The code is all open-source, the process is all open to the public. The team is doing livestreams and recording a podcast. I am impressed.

In particular, John Palmer has been an excellent organizer and communicator for the project. Among other duties he's been sharing [weekly updates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YcJGA-bLK7UfNEkethB2PTJWBzTfuW0hmNx2p1Uzf64/edit#) that are dramatically better than what I've seen at both venture-backed startups and comparable open-source projects. His [What is PartyDAO](https://party.mirror.xyz/xte55cT3ESlQRP62KYxupRbha7A1O6MMHhKMIzfmLyg) post does a great job capturing what is special about this group:

> PartyDAO has two primary mandates.
> 
> 1.  Ship PartyBid, a product for collective bidding on NFTs
> 2.  Build PartyDAO itself into a long-lasting organization that can fund its own continued existence
>
> PartyDAO is different from many DAOs that have come before it. To date, DAOs have mostly been synonymous with a treasury of funds + group voting on where to send those funds. PartyDAO aims to be something more fun: **we are a fully decentralized organization that actually ships products**.
