There was a livestreamed collaborative design session for [PartyDAO](https://party.mirror.xyz/) on Monday, which was a lot of fun to watch. There is a [public Figma board](https://www.figma.com/file/129WL3Stz1PKSMblzG0ton/PartyDAO?node-id=0%3A1) you can dig through.

The group is building PartyBid, a new app for collectively bidding on NFTs, like a scaled version of [PleasrDAO](https://decrypt.co/66933/why-this-dao-bought-snowden-nft). It has been amazing watching this team assemble and start building over the last few weeks, and I believe it is a repeatable model we will see more and more often.

The speed and quality of the work has been comparable to a tight-knit, VC-backed startup, but it is definitively not that. The project started when Denis Nazarov posted an idea on Twitter: "wouldn't it be cool if you could deploy an automatic DAO to bid on an NFT auction?"[\[1\]]() A group of people spontaneously organized, raised money from whoever would contribute[\[2\]](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) , and are now bringing open-source software to life. It's only been a month since that first tweet, and folks are now getting paid to build fully independent, open-source software. 

I believe PartyDAO is a sneak preview of what many startups will look like in the future. 
Spontaneously organized, cooperatively-owned, and funded by community tokens and crowdfunding. 

Unlike most DAOs, which generally just collect and distribute money, PartyDAO is actively building and shipping software. Unlike most small open-source projects, they have a budget and a path for future funding.

They are open-source not necessarily because of their belief in contributing to the public good, but because it is also an excellent marketing and recruitment strategy. They are cooperatively-organized not just because it is more fair and inclusive, but because it is less work, and everyone understands the benefits of [[skin in the game]]. The morally superior path provides practical benefits.

Building stuff is fun, and building stuff with friends is even better. Geting paid to build stuff with friends, all open-source, no bosses, plus you've got a legitimate ownership stake in what you're building? That's another level.
