title: The Demo Rules
---

these are the rules we used for the bi-weekly demo sessions at [DEF](https://twitter.com/defdao)

"a safe space to show off your projects"

## the rules

- generally 15 mins per slot: 10 mins for demo, 5 mins for Q&A, YMMV
- bugs and issues are expected. if we do a Def Demos without glitches, we have failed. 
- if presenter is having issues or app is being slow, we don't complain, we wait patiently
- if someone bravely shares their whole screen and receives a sensitive notification, you must close your eyes
- moderators will read chat and pass along questions & praise and especially praise
- free scope creep, all you can eat!

## bonus

- turn on your video if you're down, otherwise we are all just random usernames on the Internet
- demos are default-private. please don't post other people's work on social media w/o permission. we post a few screenshots in `#mouths-only-sidechat` but if you'd prefer we didn't do that, just say so. sometimes Varley edits together recap videos, but we will always ask if you're cool sharing
