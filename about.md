<p>
  I was the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHX">VHX</a>,
  a platform for selling movies and TV shows directly to fans.
  We had the privilege of working with thousands of small businesses as well as well-known artists like Dave Grohl, Kevin Hart, This American Life, Grace Helbig and more.
  We launched in 2010 and were backed by great investors like Union Square Ventures, Comcast Ventures, Lerer Ventures, Chris Sacca, Alexis Ohanian and more.
  In 2017 we were <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/2/11554434/vimeo-acquires-vhx">acquired by Vimeo</a>,
  and the product is now known as <a href="https://ott.vimeo.com/">Vimeo OTT</a>.

  After VHX and Vimeo I served as the Chief Product Officer at <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a> (2017-2018)

<p>
  Before that I was the co-founder of <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com">Know Your Meme</a>,
  a community-edited database of Internet culture.
  We also produced a web show where we would dress up in lab coats and explain the stories behind notable memes.
  KYM was acquired by the Cheezburger Network in 2011, and remains a popular destination for anyone trying to understand a weird link.
  Some of my favorite episodes are embedded below.
